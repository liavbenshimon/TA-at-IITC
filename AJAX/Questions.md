# AJAX (Fetch) Exercises for Beginners (Callback-based)

This document contains **20 exercises** focused on using **AJAX calls** in JavaScript, with an emphasis on handling AJAX via **callbacks**, not Promises. You will be interacting with a dummy API like [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). Each exercise includes an **explanation**, **hint**, and **expected output**.
